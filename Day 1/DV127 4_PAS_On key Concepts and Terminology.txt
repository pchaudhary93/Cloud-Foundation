	Q1
	What are key concepts in cloud services?
	ANS
	The key concepts in cloud services are high availability, scalability, and elasticity. 


	Q2
	What is high availability in cloud services?
	ANS
	The idea is to make your products, services, and tools available to your customers and employees at any time from anywhere using any device with an internet connection. 


	Q3
	What is scalability in cloud services?
	ANS
	It is the ability of a cloud computing system to adapt to changing computing requirements by either increasing or decreasing its resources. 


	Q4
	What is elasticity in cloud services?
	ANS
	Cloud service elasticity is the ability to increase or decrease the amount of system capacity such as CPU, storage, memory, and input/output. 


	Q5
	What is the difference between elasticity and scalability?
	ANS
	Scalability is the ability to add, remove, or reconfigure hardware and software resources to handle an increase or decrease in usage. Elasticity is automatically scaling up or down resources to meet user demands. 


	Q6
	What is agility in cloud services?
	ANS
	Cloud agility is the ability to quickly develop, test, and launch applications in a cloud-based environment. 


	Q7
	What is fault tolerance in cloud services?
	ANS
	The ability of a system computer, network, cloud cluster, etc. to continue operating without interruption when one or more of its components fail. 


	Q8
	What is disaster recovery in cloud services?
	ANS
	The strategies and services enterprise apply for the purpose of backing up applications, resources, and data into a cloud environment. 


	Q9
	What are customer latency capabilities in cloud services?
	ANS
	Cloud service latency is the delay between a client request and a cloud service providerâ€™s response. 


	Q10
	What are predictive cost considerations in cloud services?
	ANS
	The ability for users to predict what costs they will incurfor a particular cloud service.
